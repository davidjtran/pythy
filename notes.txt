To change the file structure of the reference repositories to the current version:

- Create an "assignments" folder inside each term.

- For each Assignment:
    - Assign a term_id to the assignment.
    - Move the reference repo folder (has the url_part as its name) to inside the corresponding "assignments" folder in the term folder.
